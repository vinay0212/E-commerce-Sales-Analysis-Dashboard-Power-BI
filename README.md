# E-commerce-Sales-Analysis-Dashboard-Power-BI
This project focuses on developing an **E-commerce Sales Dashboard** in Power BI to provide a comprehensive overview of business performance. The report highlights key metrics such as total revenue, profit trends, customer orders, product performance, and regional sales. By analyzing aspects like on-time vs. delayed deliveries, seasonal sales patterns, and payment preferences, the dashboard enables stakeholders to identify strengths, uncover inefficiencies, and make data-driven decisions to enhance customer satisfaction and overall business growth.

For building this project, I used **Power BI** as the primary tool for creating interactive dashboards and data visualizations. **Power Query** was utilized for data cleaning and transformation, ensuring that missing values, inconsistent data types, and redundant fields were addressed. The data model was designed with relationships across fact and dimension tables, while **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** was applied to create custom measures such as total sales, profit margin, and year-over-year growth. Additionally, slicers, filters, and drill-through features were incorporated to make the dashboard highly interactive and user-friendly.

In conclusion, this project demonstrates how Power BI can be leveraged to convert raw e-commerce data into actionable insights. The visualizations provide clarity on sales performance across different regions, customer behaviors, and product categories, ultimately supporting better strategic decision-making. With its ability to uncover patterns and highlight business opportunities, this dashboard serves as a strong example of using data visualization for business intelligence in the e-commerce
